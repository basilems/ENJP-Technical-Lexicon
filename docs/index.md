# Acknowledgements

This project is inspired by the [EN-JP-ML-Lexicon](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/EN-JP-ML-Lexicon#readme) github project. While most of the translations are taken from the [translation of Stanford's CS229 and CS230](https://github.com/shervinea/cheatsheet-translation/blob/master/ja/cs-230-deep-learning-tips-and-tricks.md). 
Here, we only aim to provide a more user-friendly platform to retrieve information while contributing to the corpus with new translations.
